More. By Philip Coggan. Hachette; 496 pages; $34. Profile Books; £25

A history of the global economy by our Bartleby columnist. Covering the development of key sectors such as manufacturing and energy production, it shows how links between people and countries have allowed individuals to grow not just more prosperous, but taller and stronger, and to live longer and have more choice in how they run their lives. A “brilliant survey”, thought the Times; a “fantastic sweep”, reckoned the Financial Times. 


Coveted. By Melanie Grant. Phaidon; 208 pages; $89.95 and £69.95

When, asks the picture and luxury editor of 1843, does jewellery make the leap from fashion accessory to art? Her richly illustrated profiles of leading designers range from Fabergé’s and Cartier’s links to Art Nouveau and Art Deco, to the collaboration between Georg Jensen, a Scandinavian brand, with the architect Zaha Hadid. The New York Times said the book showed “the complexity, power and artistic impact of great design”.

Independence Square. By A.D. Miller. Pegasus Books; 228 pages; $25.95. Harvill Secker; £14.99

A nation’s future, and a man’s fate, hang in the balance in this novel of revolution and betrayal. Set between an icy upheaval in Kyiv and a London summer, it stars a sly oligarch, an idealistic young activist and a disgraced British diplomat. “Utterly gripping,” said the Observer, “a novel with its finger on the pulse of geopolitics that still manages to move deeply.” The Spectator called it “a searing indictment of our times”. By our culture editor.

Unconventional Wisdom. Edited by Tom Standage. Economist Books; 272 pages; $11.99. Profile Books; £8.99

A compendium of our explainer articles and daily charts, which spell out how much a ghost reduces a house’s value, how pregnancy makes people more law-abiding and why friends prefer sloppily wrapped Christmas gifts. Compiled by one of our deputy editors.

The Best. By Tim Wigmore and Mark Williams. Mobius; 256 pages; $24.95. Nicholas Brealey; £20

A contributor on sport and his co-author cover topics such as why younger siblings have more chance of becoming elite sportsmen, why mid-sized towns produce the most champions and the science of performance. They draw on interviews with Marcus Rashford, Pete Sampras and Steph Curry, among others. “Excellent,” said the Australian.

The Classical School. By Callum Williams. Hachette; 288 pages; $16.99. Profile Books; £20

A high-speed history of Western economic thought, by our senior economics writer, told in the form of 20 biographies. Alongside household names such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, there are chapters on lesser-known figures such as Harriet Martineau and Dadabhai Naoroji. The Times called it a “brisk, absorbing and entertaining history lesson” with “an engaging cast of characters” that “leaves you a lot wiser”.

The Wake-Up Call. By Adrian Wooldridge and John Micklethwait. HarperVia; 176 pages; $18. Short Books; £9.99

The pandemic, say our political editor and Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, proves that government is not just a diversion for politicians but a matter of life and death. The poor performance of Western democracies, particularly America and Britain, shows how far they have fallen behind the Far East, notably China. “A shot in the arm,” said the Financial Times. “Full marks for sounding the alarm,” said the Times Literary Supplement.
