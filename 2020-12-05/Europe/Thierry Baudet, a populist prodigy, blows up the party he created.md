A PHOTO of Thierry Baudet from a newspaper profile in 2014 shows him sprawled on his grand piano, gazing fetchingly to camera. The Chopin-playing Dutch intellectual, then 31, had written a book denouncing the EU. Two years later he co-founded a party, Forum For Democracy (FVD), which won the largest vote-share in provincial elections in 2019. In a speech that night Mr Baudet described it as a world-historical turning point, invoking Hegel’s “owl of Minerva”, a symbol of wisdom that “spreads its wings only [at] dusk”.

This month the FVD blew itself up in a series of scandals, and music again played a role. At a dinner on November 20th a newly recruited politician wanted to play 1980s disco. Mr Baudet insisted on classical. Soon, says an FVD senator who later quit the party, Mr Baudet was ranting that covid-19 was a plot by George Soros. He answered worries about anti-Semitism in the party by saying that “almost everyone I know is anti-Semitic.” (He later repudiated these statements, but did not explain what he had meant.)


The next day a newspaper published chats full of racist and anti-Semitic vitriol among FVD’s youth wing, run by Mr Baudet’s ally, Freek Jansen. Rather than fire Mr Jansen, Mr Baudet quit as parliamentary leader. But he stayed on as an MP, and said he would return as leader if members asked. The FVD’s provincial and city office-holders began deserting the party. So did its other MP and most of its senators, including Paul Cliteur, a legal philosopher whose department at the University of Leiden served as FVD’s intellectual breeding ground.

As recently as March polls gave FVD about 11% of the vote. But as Mr Baudet flirted with covid-19 conspiracy nutjobbery, its support slid to around 3%. Many who once thought Mr Baudet merely provocative now see him as a dangerous crank. Henk Otten, a senator and one of the party’s co-founders, was pushed out last year after warning that Mr Baudet was being radicalised. He says he has turned into a “fascist psychopath”.

FVD’s board says the party’s 40,000-odd members will vote on whether or not Mr Baudet should return. Mr Otten says the statutes do not provide for that. But Chris Aalberts, author of a book about the party, says its rules do not matter much: “It is a one-man system.” Mr Baudet may stay on as head of a rump FVD and win a few seats at the general election in March. Geert Wilders, the head of the Netherlands’ other far-right populist party, is overjoyed. As FVD has withered, its voters have come over to him.
