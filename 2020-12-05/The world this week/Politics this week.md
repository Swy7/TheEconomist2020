Britain became the first country to license a fully tested vaccine for covid-19. The medicines regulator gave its approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab following a “rolling review” process, used to assess promising vaccines during a health emergency. Data from the vaccination programme will continue to be reviewed as they become available. Priority distribution will start within a week. America is expected to approve a vaccine soon and the EU by the end of the month.


Boris Johnson faced his biggest backbench rebellion since becoming prime minister over the confusing rules in the new regional tier-system that replaced lockdown in England. Parliament approved the plan. Customers may order booze in pubs only if it comes with a substantial meal. A pub renamed one of its beers “Substantial Meal”.

President Emmanuel Macron of France ordered his government to redraft a proposed law that would have made it illegal in some circumstances to publish photographs of police. He did so after CCTV footage of three cops beating and racially abusing a black man went viral. Such footage might have been illegal to publish under the proposed law, civil libertarians noted.

Tributes were paid to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the president of France from 1974 to 1981, who has died aged 94. Mr Giscard d’Estaing helped formalise a role for the summits of Europe’s heads of state through the European Council. In France he battled the Catholic church to liberalise abortion and divorce laws.

Cuban police arrested 14 members of a dissident group called Movimiento San Isidro. They had locked themselves into the movement’s headquarters in Havana, and some went on hunger and thirst strikes, to protest against the jailing of Denis Solís, a rapper charged with disrespecting authority. After the raid hundreds of activists gathered at the culture ministry. In a small but rare concession, the vice-minister of culture met a delegation representing them.

Brazil’s space agency reported that 11,000 square km (4,000 square miles) of forest were destroyed in the Amazon from August 2019 to July 2020, the most since 2008.

Ethiopian forces entered Mekelle, the capital of the northern region of Tigray, less than a month after the start of a civil war between the federal government and the regional one. Tigrayan fighters have withdrawn from towns in the region in order to launch a guerrilla war.

Bobi Wine suspended his presidential campaign in Uganda after members of his staff were injured when security forces fired rubber bullets at one of his rallies. In November at least 54 people were killed, most of them by the security forces. Mr Wine is running against Yoweri Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986.

The Iranian government accused an opposition group of working with Israel to assassinate Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s most senior nuclear scientist, using a remote-controlled machine gun. Iran’s parliament passed plans to ramp up the country’s nuclear programme. But President Hassan Rouhani opposed the move, which would endanger a potential rapprochement with America under Joe Biden.

Israel’s parliament passed a preliminary proposal to dissolve itself, moving the country closer to a fourth election in under two years.

Joe Biden filled out the rest of his economic team for his incoming government. Cecilia Rouse will lead the Council of Economic Advisers, and Brian Deese the National Economic Council. Both were advisers in the White House during the global financial crisis in 2009. The choice of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget is more controversial. Ms Tanden has reportedly deleted 1,000 tweets that disparaged Republican senators she now has to count on to confirm her in the job.

A court in Hong Kong sentenced a prominent pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, to more than 13 months in prison for his role in a protest last year. Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, who were fellow leaders of his now disbanded group, Demosisto, were also jailed.

In Beijing a court began hearings into a case involving a woman who says a television host sexually harassed her. He has denied the charge. The alleged offence has become a cause célèbre among campaigners in China for women’s rights.

Hundreds of thousands of farmers besieged Delhi, blocking highways. They demanded the scrapping of recent agricultural reforms, which could allow the Indian government to stop offering guaranteed prices for crops.

Indonesia called off plans for an 11-day holiday subsuming Christmas and the new year, for fear that people travelling would spread covid-19. The extra holidays had been intended to make up for ones scrapped earlier this year to help curb the epidemic.

The National Assembly in South Korea approved a change allowing K-pop stars who have won government awards to defer mandatory military service until the age of 30, instead of 28. This came days before the 28th birthday of a member of BTS, the world’s most successful band.
Coronavirus briefs


The number of daily deaths in America approached their highest levels during the pandemic. The number of people in hospital with the disease surged in November and is now above 100,000.

Los Angeles County, the most populous in the United States, entered a three-week period of tight restrictions during which people are urged to stay at home and wear face masks outside. Meeting other households is banned.

Vietnam reported its first locally transmitted case of covid-19 in nearly three months.

Many businesses reopened in Ireland after a six-week lockdown. People still cannot travel outside their county, however, except for work, study or health reasons.

Hong Kong reduced the limit on the number of people who can gather in public from four to two.
