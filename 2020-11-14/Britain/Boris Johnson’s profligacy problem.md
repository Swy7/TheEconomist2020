IF BRITONS GET a covid-19 vaccine next spring, the government wants them to thank Kate Bingham (pictured). A big shot in venture capital, she is the head of the government’s vaccines taskforce, a body which has placed early orders for 340m vaccine doses. She has also been in the limelight for less favourable reasons: her taskforce spent £670,000 ($883,000) on public relations advisers, she was accused of divulging sensitive information to an investor conference—and, to cap it all, she is married to a Tory minister.
Ms Bingham’s case represents the tensions in Boris Johnson’s government. To its fans, it is bringing in skilled outsiders to do jobs that politicians cannot, and stripping out the penny-pinching bureaucracy that hobbles ambitious programmes. To its critics, it has tossed aside proper spending controls and is becoming a chumocracy.

Jolyon Maugham, a campaigning lawyer, is suing the government over contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE), which he claims were improperly awarded to a pest-control firm and a confectionery wholesaler. Mr Maugham also accuses the government of wrongly handing deals to consultants close to the Conservative Party. The two big pandemic-related jobs went to well-connected people: Ms Bingham and Dido Harding, a businesswoman who is head of the covid-19 testing regime and is also married to a Tory MP. She was hired without a public recruitment process. Peter Riddell, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said last month that non-executive board memberships, intended to bring business expertise into government, were being used to promote political allies.
The pandemic is part of the explanation, for it has forced the government to spend money and fill jobs with wartime haste. In a reply to Mr Maugham, the government’s lawyers describe a global scramble for PPE which made a normal tendering process impossible. Not surprisingly, the number of ministerial directions—official notices from ministers approving spending on projects that senior civil servants think may be irregular, undeliverable or poor value for money—has increased sharply in the pandemic.
The political climate has changed too. David Cameron’s government made reducing the deficit its central political goal; it hunted out spending on biscuits, air travel and consultants by officials. This government, by contrast, will make a virtue of largesse as it seeks to hold working-class seats it won from Labour in the last election, and believes in state intervention in industry. In June, the business secretary issued a direction to buy a $500m stake in OneWeb, a bankrupt satellite company, saying it would signal “UK ambition and influence on the world stage”. Officials warned the investment may fail. On November 11th the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said ministers had exposed themselves to allegations of political bias when they allocated £3.6bn of grants to provincial towns before last year’s general election by “vague and broad-brush” criteria. Preparations for Brexit also encouraged bad habits: in 2019 the government was sued by Eurotunnel over a hastily-arranged contract for ferries in case of a no-deal exit.
A third factor is Number 10’s attitude to civil-service procedure. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief aide, has long complained that risk-averse civil servants use European procurement law to choke projects and believes that the state should back high-risk projects that the market won’t fund. The government differs from its predecessors in its obsession with speed and appetite for risk in using public money, reckons Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC. “This is where the civil service has to be robust.” Former mandarins sympathise with Mr Cummings’s frustration at procurement rules, and few doubt the need for haste in the pandemic. But if such processes put a ceiling on dynamism and brilliance, they also provide a floor against waste and graft. ■
